The ModelMapper Dependency version 3.2.1 worked fine instead of new versioin 3.2.2

Adding the lombok dependency in the initializing time did not work me, after removing all lombok plugins and
dependency and again adding lombok dependency worked fine

Make sure the Getters and Setters. Missed for ErrorDetails class, then spring boot used the default handler

AuthenticationManager bean has to be created explicitly like ModelMapper
